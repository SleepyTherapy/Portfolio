  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>
    My name is <strong>Therapy</strong> (Nevaeh in real life). I am a 16-year-old artist who primarily specializes in traditional art, with growing experience in digital illustration and design. I began drawing at a very young age—learning how to hold crayons and pencils around the age of two—and have continued developing my skills ever since.
  </p>
  <p>
    Art has always been more than a hobby for me; it is a lifelong passion and career goal. My work focuses on expressive storytelling, character design, and emotional visuals meant to bring happiness and inspiration to others.
  </p>
  <p>
    I officially began pursuing art professionally in <strong>January 2024</strong>, focusing on commissions, portfolio development, and sharing my work with a wider audience.
